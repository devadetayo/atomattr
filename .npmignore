Ignore source files (users only need dist)

src/
rollup.config.js

Ignore website/demo files

index.html
docs.html
playground.html
cheatsheet.html
blog.html
blog/
assets/

Ignore dev config

.gitignore
.npmignore
node_modules/


### 2. The `package.json` Files List

You have already configured this correctly, but let's double-check. In your `package.json`, the `files` array acts as a "whitelist". NPM will **ONLY** include files listed here, ignoring everything else (unless forced by other rules).

```json
"files": [
  "dist",
  "README.md",
  "LICENSE"
]


How it works together:

GitHub: Sees everything (Source, Website, Docs).

NPM: Sees only what is in the dist folder + README/LICENSE.

3. The Launch Sequence (Executing the Plan)

Now that your protection is in place, follow these steps to launch.

Step A: Local Build (The "Production" Artifact)

Run this to ensure your dist/ folder is fresh and perfect.

npm run build


Step B: Git Push (The Website Launch)

This pushes everything to GitHub so your site goes live.

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Launch: Quanta AtomAttr v0.0.1"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/devadetayo/quanta-atomattr.git
git push -u origin main


Action: Go to GitHub Settings -> Pages -> Source: main / root. Your website is now online!

Step C: NPM Publish (The Library Launch)

This pushes only the engine to the registry.

npm login
npm publish --access public
